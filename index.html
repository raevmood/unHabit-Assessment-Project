      <h2>What is unHabit?</h2>
      <p>unHabit is an accountability-focused organization dedicated to helping members stay on track in their addiction recovery journey. The idea was born out of the low retention and high relapse rates often seen in traditional rehab centers, where many individuals fall back into harmful habits.</p>
      <p>unHabit provides a structured support system for individuals overcoming addiction and self-destructive habits. Through access to licensed therapists, personalized daily recovery plans, peer-led accountability groups, and therapist-approved self-improvement courses, we offer a holistic, adaptable path to lasting change.</p>
