--- Key Information About unHabit ---

**Our Founder and Origin Story:**
unHabit was founded by The current CEO and Licenced Behavioral Therapist Karanja Kariuki. The idea was born from his experience working at a rehab facility where he saw many individuals relapse after treatment. He realized there was a critical gap in post-rehab accountability and long-term support. unHabit was created to fill that gap and help keep people in recovery.

**Our Mission:**
Our mission is to empower anyone burdened by addiction and give them the resources necessary to escape, recover, and help others do the same. We believe recovery is not a one-time event, but an ongoing journey of healing, growth, and connection.

**Our Four Key Services:**

1.  **Access to Licensed Behavioral Therapists:** Members are connected with licensed therapists for online sessions. These focus on personalized support and creating long-term recovery strategies.

2.  **Addicts Anonymous Meetups:** These are peer-led accountability sessions, held in person monthly and more frequently online. They are designed to help members build real, dependable support networks.

3.  **Skill-Building Courses:** These courses are for members who have made progress in their recovery. They help rebuild essential life skills, boost confidence, and make it easier to reintegrate into society.

4.  **Personalized Recovery Plans:** We create daily activity planners tailored to each individual's unique healing journey. These plans consider factors like the specific addiction, age, social situation, and mental state to humanize and personalize the recovery process completely.

**Our Approach:**
Our approach is community-first, centered on empathy, accountability, and second chances. We provide safe, flexible therapy from home and structured support groups to foster trust and reduce isolation.
