unHabit is a community-driven mental wellness startup founded by Karanja Kariuki. The idea for unHabit was born out of his experience working at a seasonal rehab facility, where he saw many individuals relapse after treatment. He realized that while rehab can offer detox and short-term recovery, there was a gap in post-rehab accountability and long-term healing. unHabit was created to fill that gap — to keep free addicts free.

unHabit’s mission is to empower anyone burdened by addiction and give them the resources necessary to escape, recover, and help others do the same. We believe recovery is not a one-time event, but an ongoing journey of healing, growth, and connection.

We offer four key services:
1. Access to Licensed Behavioral Therapists – Members are connected to therapists who offer online sessions focused on personalized support and long-term recovery strategies.
2. Addicts Anonymous Meetups – These are peer-led accountability sessions, held in person monthly and more frequently online, helping members build real support networks.
3. Skill-Building Courses – Tailored for members who've made recovery progress, these courses help rebuild life skills, boost confidence, and ease reintegration into society.
4. Recovery plans tailored for personal healing journeys - These are daily activity planners that work with the individual's addiction in mind, their age, social status, mental state and other factors. This is done in order to humanise and personalise the process completely.
Our features include safe, flexible therapy access from home, and structured support groups that foster trust and reduce isolation. unHabit's approach is community-first, and everything we do is centered around empathy, accountability, and second chances.
